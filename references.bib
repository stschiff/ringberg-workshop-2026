               quality genomes from 300 individuals from 142 diverse

               pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our
               analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome
               variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations
               has accelerated by about 5\% in non-Africans compared to Africans
               since divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of
               present-day human populations were substantially separated by
               100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested
               onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that
               indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive
               substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans;
               instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming
               from the same source as that of other non-Africans.",

              method for predicting historical male and female generation times
              based on changes in the mutation spectrum. Our analyses of
              whole-genome data reveal an average generation time of 26.9 years
              across the past 250,000 years, with fathers consistently older
              (30.7 years) than mothers (23.2 years). Shifts in sex-averaged
              generation times have been driven primarily by changes to the age
              of paternity, although we report a substantial increase in female
              generation times in the recent past. We also find a large
              difference in generation times among populations, reaching back to
              a time when all humans occupied Africa.",

              across the globe, but little is known about the past. Here we
              analyze ancient DNA, leveraging that parental relatedness leaves
              genomic traces in the form of runs of homozygosity. We present an
              approach to identify such runs in low-coverage ancient DNA data
              aided by haplotype information from a modern phased reference
              panel. Simulation and experiments show that this method robustly
              detects runs of homozygosity longer than 4 centimorgan for ancient
              individuals with at least 0.3 \texttimes{} coverage. Analyzing
              genomic data from 1,785 ancient humans who lived in the last
              45,000 years, we detect low rates of first cousin or closer unions
              across most ancient populations. Moreover, we find a marked decay
              in background parental relatedness co-occurring with or shortly
              after the advent of sedentary agriculture. We observe this signal,
              likely linked to increasing local population sizes, across several
              geographic transects worldwide.",

  abstract  = "A long genomic segment inherited by a pair of individuals from a
               single, recent common ancestor is said to be identical-by-descent
               (IBD). Shared IBD segments have numerous applications in
               genetics, from demographic inference to phasing, imputation,
               pedigree reconstruction, and disease mapping. Here, we provide a
               theoretical analysis of IBD sharing under Markovian
               approximations of the coalescent with recombination. We describe
               a general framework for the IBD process along the chromosome
               under the Markovian models (SMC/SMC'), as well as introduce and
               justify a new model, which we term the renewal approximation,
               under which lengths of successive segments are independent. Then,
               considering the infinite-chromosome limit of the IBD process, we
               recover previous results (for SMC) and derive new results (for
               SMC') for the mean number of shared segments longer than a cutoff
               and the fraction of the chromosome found in such segments. We
               then use renewal theory to derive an expression (in Laplace
               space) for the distribution of the number of shared segments and
               demonstrate implications for demographic inference. We also
               compute (again, in Laplace space) the distribution of the
               fraction of the chromosome in shared segments, from which we
               obtain explicit expressions for the first two moments. Finally,
               we generalize all results to populations with a variable
               effective size.",
