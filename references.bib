  abstract  = "Here we report the Simons Genome Diversity Project data set: high
               quality genomes from 300 individuals from 142 diverse
               populations. These genomes include at least 5.8 million base
               pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our
               analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome
               variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations
               has accelerated by about 5\% in non-Africans compared to Africans
               since divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of
               present-day human populations were substantially separated by
               100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested
               onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that
               indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive
               substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans;
               instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming
               from the same source as that of other non-Africans.",
