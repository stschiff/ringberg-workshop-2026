               quality genomes from 300 individuals from 142 diverse
               populations. These genomes include at least 5.8 million base
               pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our
               analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome
               variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations
               has accelerated by about 5\% in non-Africans compared to Africans
               since divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of
               present-day human populations were substantially separated by
               100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested
               onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that
               indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive
               substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans;
               instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming
               from the same source as that of other non-Africans.",

  abstract = "The generation times of our recent ancestors can tell us about
              both the biology and social organization of prehistoric humans,
              placing human evolution on an absolute time scale. We present a
              method for predicting historical male and female generation times
              based on changes in the mutation spectrum. Our analyses of
              whole-genome data reveal an average generation time of 26.9 years
              across the past 250,000 years, with fathers consistently older
              (30.7 years) than mothers (23.2 years). Shifts in sex-averaged
              generation times have been driven primarily by changes to the age
              of paternity, although we report a substantial increase in female
              generation times in the recent past. We also find a large
              difference in generation times among populations, reaching back to
              a time when all humans occupied Africa.",
